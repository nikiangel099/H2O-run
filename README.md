# H2O-run
If running a live ohm run, run 'live_ohm_run.py' (ensure the computer is plugged into GPIB device; live ohm run must be ran before live irr run)
To analyze the results: run 'ohm_run_analysis.py'
If running a live irr (irradiation ) run, run 'live_irr_run.py' (ensure the computer is plugged into GPIB device)
To analyze the results: run 'irr_run_analysis.py'

If you just wish to analyse old ohm/irr data:
Simply change the filenames in 'read_from_file' and run either 'ohm_run_analysis.py'/'irr_run_analysis.py'
